# Atenna Signup
Atenna Signup is the realization of a sign up and sign in to a company called ATENNA. 

The user creates an account on ATENNA's main site.  

Certain verifications are done before the signup can be valid like: 
<li>If the account doesn't exist already</li>
<li>If the data enter follow the norms and are valid</li>  

After signup complete the user is redirected to a a user account page. 

The user also has the possibility to sign in to an already existing account via login, verifications are also made to ensure account is valaid and in the system already. After the verifications the user is redirected to user account page. 

I used the browser's local storage for all data persistency.
